## Main content

1. **Data formation and access**: Fetch and collect different types of data, PDF, XML etc. database 
access with SQL and ORM.

2. **Data quality and cleaning**: Standardization, normalization (Min-max, z-score, log ...), NLP transformation
(Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stemming), Pairwise matching score.

3. **Data visualization**: Benefits of data visualization, different visual methods (Histograms, charts etc.),
High dimension visualization, dimensionality reduction (PCA and SVD algorithms), drawbacks of PCA.

4. **Restful API and client**: HTTP request methods, XML-based and restful API, uniform interface, statelessness,
caching, swagger, SOAP vs REST, API design, API security (Authentication, token-based methods etc..), O-Auth.

5. **Data analytics**: Bayes theorem, overview of data mining, correlation, similarity measure, unsupervised 
learning, clustering (K-Means, K-Means++), association rules mining (Apriori algorithm).

6. **Supervised learning**: Linear regression, least square error (R-square values and p values), logistic 
regression, instance-based method (KNN), decision tree, build decision tree (entropy, ID3 algorithm), overfitting,
cross validation, bagging decision tree, random forest.

7. **Neural networks**: Gradient ascent/descent, forward pass, back propagation, activation and loss functions, 
learning rates, avoid overfitting (early stopping and dropout), Tensorflow and Keras, CNN, CNN convolution, RNN, 
RNN back propagation, long short-term memory (LSTM).

8. **Recommender Systems**: Collaborative filtering, pearson correlation, user-based vs item-based vs content-based,
latent factor based model, SVD based model, TF-IDF method, cosine similarity, knowledge-based approaches, hybrid 
recommender systems, accuracy (MAE, RMSE).
